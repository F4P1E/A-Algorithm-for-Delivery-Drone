    "##### Use Case:\n",
    "    Grid maps where movement is restricted to horizozntal and vertical directions only.\n",
    "##### Benefits:\n",
    "    Simple to implement, as the formula involves basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, and absolute value).\n",
    "##### Drawbacks:\n",
    "    1. It does not consider diagonal or other types of movement, which may result in inefficient pathfinding when diagonal moves are possible.\n",

    "    * Let $d$ be the number of steps from the start to the goal.\n",
    "##### Time Efficiency of A*:\n",
    "    In the worst-case scenario, the time efficiency of A* is $O(b^d)$, meaning that every neighbouring node might be visited on the way from the start to the goal. This situation can arise with poor heuristic functions. Conversely, with a perfect heuristic function, A* will visit only that nodes on the path, resulting in a time efficiency of $O(d)$. In practice, the performance of A* typically falls between these two extremes and is heavily influenced by the accuracy of the heuristic function.\n",
    "    $O(b^d)$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - $b$ is the branching factor, representing the average number of successors per state.\n",
    "    - $d$ is the depth of the optimal solution, which in this case would correspond to the length of the shortest path from the start node to the goal node.\n",
    "##### Space Efficiency of A*:\n",
    "    Due to A* storing all neighbouring nodes as well as path nodes in memory, the space complexity in the worst case can be $O(b^d)$. This means that as the path length increases, the amount of memory used grows exponentially, making A* potentially unsuitable for large-scale pathfinding problems.\n",
    "##### The Path Cost:\n",
    "    The path cost of the solution is the total number of steps required to move from the starting location to the destination along the optimal path found by the algorithm. This is calculated as the length of the path minus one."
